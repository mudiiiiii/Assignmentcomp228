Question 1.1 - In your own words, list two problems that regression algorithms can be used to solve and why, based on their characteristics
Answer
- Regression algorithm can be used to solve the problem of predicting the temperature for any given day based on factors such as wind speed, humidity,
and athmospheric pressure because Regression is a type of problem that use of machine learning algorithms to learn the continous mapping function.
- Regression algorithm can be used to predict the sales revenue of a company based on previous data of sales, this would help Companies manage their budget in an easier way

Question 1.2 - In your own words, List two problems that belong to classification problem and why, based on their characteristics.
Answer
- Classifying if an identity is spam to prevent getting scammed with a trained machine learning model to identify spam emails based on email, language/content.
- Classifying documents in different categories based on the classification model function that maps from a document to a category label.

Question 1.3 - In your own words, List two problems that can be solved by using clustering algorithm(s) and why, based on their characteristics.
Answer
- Identifying fraudlent activities with the use of clustering algorithms such as GPS logs, which is used to group similar behaviors. based on characteristics
it will offer protection and enable anyone to differentiate the real and the fake.
- With the K-means Clustering, you can predict the best players for your fantansy team based on player performances to improve chances of winning more points and rewards 

Question 1.4 - In your own words, what is anomaly detection?
Answer
Anomaly detection is the process of identifying data points, events, or observations that deviates from a dataset's normal behaviour. It is the identification of
unexpected events that difer from the norm.
